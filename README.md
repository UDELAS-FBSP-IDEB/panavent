# Panavent Project - Gas Mixer for Mechanical Ventilators Using PID Controllers

This repository contains all the necessary components for the design and implementation of a gas mixer for mechanical ventilators, using a system of PID controllers in multiloop and parallel configuration. The project provides a comprehensive solution that includes hardware designs, control system algorithms, 3D models, and complete source code for replication and further development.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a gas mixer capable of precisely controlling the mixture of gases in mechanical ventilators, critical for patient care in medical settings. The system integrates PID controllers to ensure accurate gas delivery according to set parameters.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `/Electronics`: Contains electronic circuit schematics and hardware design files used in the gas mixer.
- `/3DModels`: 3D models and designs for the components used in the gas mixer.
- `/SourceCode`: The full code used for the control system, designed to run on the embedded platform.

## Features

- **Precise Gas Mixing**: Achieved using PID controllers in a multiloop and parallel configuration.
- **Open Source**: All designs, code, and models are provided as open-source materials.
- **Comprehensive**: Includes electronic design, mechanical components, and the full control algorithm.
- **Replicable**: All components can be replicated and adapted for various applications in medical settings.

## Requirements

- MPLAB X IDE and a PICkit programmer for executing the code of the microcontroller.
- Visual Studio 2017 or later for compiling and running the PC software.
- 3D printer for generating the physical components.
- Basic knowledge of PID control systems and electronics.
